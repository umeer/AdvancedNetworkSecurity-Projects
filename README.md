# Advanced Network Security Projects
This repository contains a series of projects relative to network security (attack and mitigation). 
The project's complexity grows with the increase of their numbering, hence the project #6 is more intricate than #1.

Every projects folder contains the following files:
- Description document which defines the guidelines/deliverables and in some cases input and example of output files.
- The project source code
